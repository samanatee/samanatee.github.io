My name is Samantha Hangsan. I'm an interdisciplinary engineer, artist, and student, intent on blurring the lines between as many media and genres as I can.
<br><br>
From 2016-2017, I worked at the [UCLA Tectonics & Structural Geology Lab](https://faculty.epss.ucla.edu/~yin/index.html). After that, I worked at [Shannon & Wilson, Inc.](https://www.shannonwilson.com/), a consulting firm that is dedicated to providing comprehensive engineering and environmental solutions for the most challenging infrastructure planning, design, permitting and construction conditions. Presently, I am halfway through the computer science post-baccalaureate program at California State University, Long Beach. I currently work as a graduate researcher, a position that gives me the time, space, and support to deep-dive into machine learning and design space exploration.
